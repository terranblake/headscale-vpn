# Chromecast Integration Solution Summary

## The Problem
You want to expose your home Jellyfin media server to TVs with Chromecast on remote networks (family, friends) where:
- Users are not technically proficient
- You don't have router admin access
- Chromecast can't run VPN clients
- Setup must be as simple as possible

## The Solution: Bridge Device Approach

### How It Works
```
[Your Home Network]     [VPN Tunnel]     [Remote Network]
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Jellyfin Server │◄──►│ Headscale   │◄──►│ Bridge Device   │
│ 192.168.1.100   │    │ VPN Server  │    │ 192.168.1.100   │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                    ▲
                                                    │ Local Network
                                                    ▼
                                          ┌─────────────────┐
                                          │   Chromecast    │
                                          │ "Sees" Local    │
                                          │ Jellyfin Server │
                                          └─────────────────┘
```

### Key Components

1. **Bridge Device** (Raspberry Pi, Mini PC, etc.)
   - Connects to your VPN
   - Appears as "local" Jellyfin server to Chromecast
   - Proxies all requests through VPN to your real server

2. **Service Discovery**
   - mDNS advertising makes Jellyfin discoverable
   - SSDP responder for UPnP discovery
   - Chromecast finds server automatically

3. **Transparent Proxy**
   - All HTTP requests forwarded to real server
   - Responses modified for local URLs
   - Streaming works exactly like local server
